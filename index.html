            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Ma'laijah Garris. I am a computer science major at the University of South Carolina. I have also loved working with computers since I can remember.
                My goal is to graduate and move on to getting a steady career that can not only give me a chance to work, but also give me more information and even advice on how to become better at my job.
                I am currently working on multiple certifications and I plan to be one of the best employees that I can be. I am reliable and very trustworthy.
